## About Me

**Who I Am**  
Crypto trader and developer who got tired of bad bots, so I built my own AI trading system.

**What I Built**  
This bot uses real AI models and connects to Bitget, Blofin, and Binance through their APIs for fully automated trading.

**How It Works**  
Machine learning handles predictions, pattern detection, and all trading decisions – hitting 5-25% daily returns with smart risk management.

**The Tech Stack**  
Built with custom API integrations, AI training pipelines, and monitoring systems that run 24/7 without babysitting.

**Real Money Testing**  
Everything here is tested with actual capital, not just backtests – if it doesn't work in real markets, it doesn't go in.

**Always Improving**  
The system learns and gets better based on live performance, not some outdated strategy from 2018.

**Here to Help**  
Happy to help you with API setup, bot configuration, or any questions about trading automation.
